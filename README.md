# PID Control of a DC Motor
A basic **PID- Proportional, Integrative, Differentiative** Controller for a **DC Motor with an Encoder**.</br>

The salient features of PID Control are:
<ul>
  <li><b>Proprtional</b> control linearly adjusts the error in order to minimise it.</li>
  <li>**Integral** control accumulated the past error to give a jerk free control.</li>
  <li>**Differential** control takes in consideration the future aspect to make the control steady.</li>
</ul>
